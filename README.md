<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an awesome project, which can automatic login Facebook and send random monkey image to a friend / colleague.

Here's the reason why I made this:
* I have a colleague named Kevin, he is a monkey.

<p align="center">

<p>

So I decided to waste three hours writing this project.

If you also have a colleague who is a monkey, welcome to the zoo !
